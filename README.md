# Miniature Tribble

## The Map
Miniature Tribble (WIP title)

## Information
Miniature Tribble (the current codename for this project and subject to change) is a **competitive, two-four player map** that is built and played within the game *Quake*. The map is completeley **symmetrical** and in the middle of the map is a **powerful weapon** that can be used by one player to help dominate the others. There will be reliable cover, although the map is relatively small, and each player will begin with the same loadout. The map will have a figure-eight flow as players will be able to travel anywhere, including other spawns.
